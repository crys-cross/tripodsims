## VISION

*Tripod Support envisions to be the center of dynamic learning that will ignite the potentials of the organizations’ respective individuals in their quest for personal and professional growth in alignment to organizational goals and culture.



## MISSION

*Our mission is to liberate and empower personalities and human structure to fully enhance their effectiveness for the purpose of realizing and acting towards a meaningful life. We further commit ourselves to serve as “coaches” in unlocking a person’s potential to maximize their own performance by helping them to learn rather than exclusively teaching them.
